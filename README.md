**Financial Advisory Chatbot for Retail Investors**
Cameron Cooray
Introduction
Investing in the stock market can be overwhelming, especially for novice investors who struggle to navigate financial jargon, track stock performance, and make informed decisions. Many retail investors turn to online research, social media, or financial news for guidance, but these sources can be inconsistent, confusing, or even misleading.
To address this challenge, I am developing a Financial Advisory Chatbot, a web-based AI assistant designed to provide quick, accurate, and easy-to-understand investment insights for retail investors. Unlike basic chatbots that simply generate generic responses, this chatbot integrates real-time market data, ensuring users get up-to-date and relevant financial information.
What the Chatbot Does
The chatbot allows users to ask investment-related questions and receive instant, AI-driven responses powered by GPT-4-turbo. Users can inquire about stock prices, market trends, and investment strategies in a natural, conversational way.
For example, a user might ask:
“What’s the latest price of Tesla (TSLA)?”
“Is Apple (AAPL) a good long-term investment?”
“What are the key financial metrics for NVIDIA?”
The chatbot will then:
Process the question using OpenAI’s GPT-4-turbo.
Fetch real-time stock data from APIs like Yahoo Finance.
Analyze the data and generate a response, incorporating AI-powered insights.
Display the answer in a clean, user-friendly web interface.


How It Works
The chatbot will be built as a web app, utilizing:
Python (FastAPI) for the backend
Next.js (React) for the frontend
GPT-4-turbo as the AI model
Yahoo Finance API for real-time market data
This structure ensures fast response times and a smooth user experience.
